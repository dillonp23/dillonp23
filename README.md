# Hi, I'm Dillon! 🤙
## 🚀 About me
- Former immunology lab researcher
- Began designing & developing websites in 2016
- 4+ years collaborating w/ business owners to build their websites
- Started learning iOS development in 2019
- 2.5+ years of experience building mobile applications in Swift

I'm most interested in building consumer-facing applications that prioritize good design and have a longing to work on a team that shares this ethos. I love to work in fast-paced environments, where each day brings about new and exciting challenges that require me to learn new skills and exercise my brain to solve problems I've never encountered before. I get bored when I feel like I'm not actively facing challenges, or when I'm not able to be creative and come up with ideas for improvement - probably explains why lab research just wasn't in the cards for me 🤷‍♂️

I have a strong desire to work with a team at a small-medium stage startup. An environment where I can constantly face new challenges, learn from others with more experience and prepare for the inevitable day that I decide to run with one of my ideas, seek funding, and become a startup founder myself.
